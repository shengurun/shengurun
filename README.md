# Hi! I'm shengurun.

- I'm currently learning **game design** and **photography**.
- Among all programming language, I'm interested in **Python**, **Golang** and **Rust**.

Summer is a time to relax, regroup and catch up on all those things you've been putting off all year. Now, my short-term goal is already planned.

**August 25, 2021. I'm back!**
